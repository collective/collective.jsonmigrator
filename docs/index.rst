collective.jsonmigrator's documentation!
==================================================

The purpose of the ``collective.jsonmigrator`` package is to provide a set of
blueprints that help you to migrate content into `Plone`_. (``blueprint`` is
an extension to `collective.transmogrifier`_).

It provides a list of blueprints built around
``collective.jsonmigrator.jsonsource``
with the purpose of providing flexible infrastructure to do migrations in Plone.

And just incase you forgot, migration is a bitch... so have fun :P
